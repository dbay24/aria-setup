                <p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
                <h2>The Empire Strikes Back</h2>
                <p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Red Five standing by. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.</li>
                <li>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</li>
                <li>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Revenge of the Sith</h3>
                <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. He is here. He is here. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
                <h4>The Empire Strikes Back</h4>
                <p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? What?! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</li>
                <li>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>The Phantom Menace</h5>
                <p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. He is here. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
